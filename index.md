 **Title:** Locally Testable Non-Malleable Codes
  
 **Abstract:** In this work we adapt the notion of non-malleability for codes of Dziembowski, Pietrzak and Wichs (ICS 2010) to locally testable codes. Roughly speaking, a locally testable code is non-malleable if any tampered codeword which passes the local test with good probability is close to a valid codeword which either encodes the original, or an unrelated message. We instantiate our definition by proving that a Reed-Muller-type code is non-malleable in the following sense: any adversary who independently tampers the coordinates of the code so that the tampered code passes the test with good probability, is tampering the underlying polynomial according to an affine transformation. To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work, polynomial codes were not known to possess any non-malleability guarantees. Our analysis builds on the sampler-based decoding techniques common to several recent works.

  **Title:** Towards a Theory of Mixing Graphs: A Characterization of Perfect Mixability
  
  **Abstract:** Some microfluidic lab-on-chip devices contain modules whose function is to mix two fluids, called reactant and buffer, in desired proportions. In one of the technologies for fluid mixing the process can be represented by a directed acyclic graph whose nodes represent micro-mixers and edges represent micro-channels. A micro-mixer has two input channels and two output channels; it receives two fluid droplets, one from each input, mixes them perfectly, and produces two droplets of the mixed fluid on its output channels. Such a mixing graph converts a set I of input droplets into a set T of output droplets, where the droplets are specified by their reactant concentrations. The most fundamental algorithmic question related to mixing graphs is to determine, given an input set I and a target set T, whether there is a mixing graph that converts I into T. We refer to this decision problem as mix-reachability. While the complexity of this problem remains open, we provide a solution to its natural sub-problem, called perfect mixability, in which we ask whether, given a collection C of droplets, there is a mixing graph that mixes C perfectly, producing only droplets whose concentration is the average concentration of C. We provide a complete characterization of such perfectly mixable sets and an efficient algorithm for testing perfect mixability. Further, we prove that any perfectly mixable set has a perfect-mixing graph of polynomial size, and that this graph can be computed in polynomial time.
